As we continue to expand, sync.theater is beginning to adopt a new brand: sync.

We will be keeping the same iconic domain name: sync.theater, but going forward we will be adopting the name <span style="color: #8C5EC1">sync.</span> to refer to the app.

This new brand consists of a new logo as seen at the top of this blog as well as below, a new set of design principles as well as a more unified color scheme.

With these new changes, users should feel more comfortable navigating the interface of sync. as well as allow us to develop a more recognizable brand.

As always feel free to give feedback, the links for that can be found on the About page via the link above.
